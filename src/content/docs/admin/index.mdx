# üë®‚Äçüíº Administrator Guide

Welcome to the administrator's section of iRankHub! As an administrator, you play a crucial role in making debate tournaments possible and helping students grow through debate. This guide walks you through everything you need to know to manage tournaments effectively.

## üìä Dashboard Overview

When you log in as an administrator, you'll see your dashboard immediately. Here you can monitor everything happening in iRankHub in real time.

### Tournament Statistics
The dashboard shows you important numbers about tournament activity:
- The number of tournaments currently running
- A list of upcoming tournaments and their dates
- How many teams are currently registering for tournaments
- Registration trends that help you plan future tournaments

### System Health Monitoring
Below the tournament statistics, you'll find the system health section. These indicators help you ensure iRankHub runs smoothly:
- CPU Usage: Shows how hard the system is working
- Memory Usage: Indicates available system resources
- Storage Space: Both temporary and permanent storage levels
- Server Status: The health of all active servers


## üé™ Tournament Management

### Debate Formats

Currently, iRankHub fully supports the World Schools Debate format. We've chosen this format because it provides an excellent foundation for students to develop their debate skills. In World Schools debates, three to five speakers per team engage in both prepared and impromptu rounds, allowing students to demonstrate both thorough research abilities and quick thinking. We're also working on adding support for British Parliamentary format, which will enable us to host university-level competitions in the future.

When you need to add a new debate format:
1. Go to Formats in your sidebar
2. Look for the "Add New Format" button in the top right corner
3. When the form appears, provide:

   **Format Name:**
   Enter a clear, descriptive name that identifies this debate format. For example, "World Schools Format" or "British Parliamentary Format."

   **Description:**
   Write a comprehensive explanation of how the format works. Include details about:
   - The basic structure of the debate
   - How many teams participate in each debate
   - The order of speeches and their duration
   - Any special rules or requirements
   - Whether there are prepared and impromptu rounds
   - How scoring works in this format

   **Number of Speakers:**
   Specify exactly how many speakers should be on each team. For example, World Schools format typically requires three speakers per team, with options for up to two additional reply speakers.

To manage existing formats, you can find them easily using the search bar at the top of the formats page. When you need to make changes, click the info icon (‚ÑπÔ∏è) on any format card. This opens a panel where you can edit the format's details or delete it if it's not being used in any tournaments.

### Tournament Leagues

Leagues help organize tournaments based on their geographic scope. Each tournament must belong to a league, which determines which schools can participate and what currency will be used for fees.

When creating a league, you'll need to specify whether it's local or international:

**Local Leagues**
These leagues are specific to Rwanda. When creating a local league:
1. Select the provinces where participating schools can be located
2. Choose specific districts within those provinces
3. The system will automatically set fees to be handled in Rwandan Francs
4. Give your league a clear, descriptive name

**International Leagues**
For tournaments that reach beyond Rwanda's borders:
1. Select which continents can participate
2. Choose eligible countries within those continents
3. The system will set fees to be handled in US Dollars
4. Create a name that reflects the international scope

Finding and managing existing leagues works similarly to formats - use the search function to find specific leagues, and click the info icon to make any necessary changes.

### Creating Tournaments

Setting up a new tournament requires careful attention to several details:

**Basic Tournament Information**
Start by providing the fundamental details:
1. Tournament name: Make it clear and memorable
2. Select the debate format you'll be using
3. Choose which league this tournament belongs to
4. Specify the physical location where debates will happen
5. Set the dates and times:
   - When the tournament starts
   - When it ends
   - Registration deadlines
6. Choose a tournament coordinator (can be an admin or volunteer)
7. Set the registration fees (system automatically uses the correct currency based on league type)

**Round Structure**
Decide how the tournament will progress:
1. Number of preliminary rounds (1-5 available)
2. How many teams will advance to elimination rounds
3. Number of judges per debate:
   - For preliminary rounds (usually 1-3)
   - For elimination rounds (typically 3)

You can also add a tournament picture to make the tournament more visually appealing and easily recognizable. Look for the camera icon in the top right of the creation form.

### Tournament Management Features
